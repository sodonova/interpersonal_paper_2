  abstract = {The goal of this chapter is not to rephrase excitation-transfer theory and three-factor theory. Their creator has dutifully updated and refined these theories whenever fresh empirical evidence or emerging conceptual developments warranted. References to these updates are provided throughout this chapter, and it should be noted that Zillmann has continued this tradition in the final chapter of this volume. Space does not allow us to attempt a history of the programmatic development of this theory or the innovative designs and methodologies used to develop them. Rather, what we have attempted to do is showcase the fine threading and lacing of theory construction that produced excitation-transfer theory and then molded it into the three-factor theory of emotion.},

  abstract = {The theory of excitation transfer addresses sequential dependencies in emotional reactivity. Specifically, it predicts an enhancement of emotional reactions to immediately present emotion-arousing situations by portions of excitation that are left over from preceding related or unrelated emotion-arousing situations (\textrightarrow{} emotion; Excitation and Arousal). The theory operationalizes excitation primarily as dominance of sympathetic activity in the autonomic nervous system and treats this activity as the main determinant of the intensity of emotional behavior and experience (Zillmann 1983, 1996). Excitation transfer theory was initially advanced and tested to explain emotional reactivity in immediate social interactions. It equally applies, however, to emotional reactivity evoked by exposure to communication. Excitation transfer may be created by emotions from message exposure and affect emotions in social interactions, be created by emotions from social interactions and affect emotions from message exposure, and be both created by and affect emotions from message exposure (Zillmann 2006).},
